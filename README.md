smartwatch agent

I want it to connect through the "call" function on the smartwatch, as well as text input through the internet.

I want to just run a simple client on my android smartphone to forward requests between the watch and a web server.

I want it to have a user-specific chat transcript as a key-value store in Redis.

I want it to have probabilistic authentication, so that it can be a free, public interface.

I want it to provide unprompted speech, partially through a public ad-buying interface.
